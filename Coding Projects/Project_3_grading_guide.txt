### Style ###
This is the exact same as the CS1428 projects and Project 1

1. Lines less than 80 characters:
    1 or 2 lines over: -1 point
    3 to 5 lines over: -2 points
    5 to 10 lines over: -3 points
    11+ lines over: -4 points

2. Variables have meaningful names:
    Pretty much everyone gets full points for this.

3. Functions and actions are fully commented
    There should be a function every 4 or 5 lines or for "complicated" actions.
    Few comments: -2 points
    Only 1 or 2 comments: -3 points
    No comments: -4 points

4. Every block indented:
    1 or 2 lines not indented: full credit
    Some indenting but it's not consistent: -1 points
    Nothing indented: -2 points

5. Code is not duplicated between branches (e.g. in an if...else):
    Only take off credit if a statement is duplicated in EVERY path of a branch.
    Every switch or if..else that contains the same statement in every path: -1 points up to 2 points off

6. File name is...
    Any other name: -1 or -2 depending on how close it is

7. Name and Date Comment:
    Name not included: -1 point
    Data not included: -1 point

### Non-functional Requirements ###

1. Robot has been defined as a class, not struct
    Pretty much yes or no. If it's still a struct: -5 points

2. Robot class has all listed member.
    Members missing X, Y, lastCommand, currentSpeed, distance, or name : -1 point each
    moveRobot is not a member function of the class: -2 points
    Program does not set names for robots: -3 points
    Position stored as a separate variable or variables, not part of Robot: -3 points
    Position not stored: -5 points

3. All functions are fully commented.
    Comments not in Parameters, Returns, Side Effects format: -1 point
    Comments in function, but not outside of function: -2 point
    Comments are very "light" (e.g. just the nam of the funciton): -4 points
    No comments: -5 points
     

4. Program stores Robot pointers
    Program always allocates space for 3 robots: -3 points
    Program stores an array of Robots, rather than Robot pointers: -4 points
    Robot list is statically allocated rather than dynamically: -6 points
    Program stores a single robot: -10 points
    
5. Robot data members are private.
    Data members are still public: -1 points each up to -5
    
6. All dynamically allocated memory is deleted
    Program fails to delete individual Robots: -2 points
    Program fails to delete roboList array: -3 points
    Program doesn't delete anything: -5 points
   

### Test Cases ###
Do not grade the test cases for programs that do not compile. Just grade them as 0 for
each test case.

Programs that crash, halt, or terminate early should be graded as a 0 for every case
that would have been tested after the halt.

Please still maintain a list of programs that crash, quit early, or do not compile. I'll
check those myself to see if they compile in a different environment for some reason.
